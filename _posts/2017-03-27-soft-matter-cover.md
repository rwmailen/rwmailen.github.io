title: Controllable Curvature in Shape Memory Polymer Sheets
excerpt: "Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a technique that uses light to get two-dimensional (2-D) plastic sheets to curve into three-dimensional (3-D) structures, such as spheres, tubes or bowls."

My work was recently published in and made the cover of Soft Matter. Additionally, the work was highlighted in a press release from NCSU. In the journal article, Amber Hubbard and I worked closely to develop a method for inducing three-dimensional curvature in initially flat polystyrene shape memory polymer sheets.
