The end of the year approaches fast, and this was a busy year! Below are a few highlights.

In February, I attended the National Science Foundation Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation workshop on the topic of "Origami Design for Integration of Self-assembling Systems for Engineering Innovation." I presented a poster during the student poster session. This was a great opportunity to interact with others involved in this NSF grant.

In March, I was a keynote speaker at the North Carolina State University Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Graduate Student Symposium. There were seven other wonderful speakers in the morning and two  poster sessions in the afternoon. This event provided a nice opportunity to see the impressive research underway in the department.

I graduated with a Master of Materials Science and Engineering (MMSE) degree in May. As part of this degree, I took courses on polymers, nanomaterials, nanoscale modeling, and advanced materials.

On July 1, I completed my preliminary oral exam. The exam included a discussion of the work I have done so far at NCSU, and I laid out my plans for the remainder of my research here. This is a major milestone leading up to my graduation next spring.

I spent this summer and fall working on two manuscripts, which have now been submitted for review. One of these manuscripts is a collaboration with Amber Hubbard in which we investigated ways to induce curvature in polymer sheets. The other paper was a study of the effects of thermomechanical loads on the self-folding behavior of shape memory polymer sheets.
