I received a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering degree from the University of Kansas in 2007. After graduating, I worked at Hawker Beechcraft in Wichita, Kansas and then L-3 Communications in both Waco, Texas and Crestview, Florida. During my time in the aerospace industry, I worked as a liaison engineer and structural analyst on a variety of military and civilian aircraft platforms. Additionally, I provided engineering support for two active flight test programs.

While at L-3 Communications I began a master's degree program at Baylor University. My research focused on finite element analysis and laminated composite manufacturing using the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique. I also learned polymer characterization techniques using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and rheology. I received a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree from Baylor University in the Fall of 2012.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering at North Carolina State University, with a planned graduation in Spring 2017. My primary research topic is finite element modeling of self-folding, polymer origami. Other topics I have studied include liquid-metal eutectic Gallium Indium (eGaIn), nanocomposites, and modeling of hydrogels.

## Current Interests and Projects:

* Polymers and polymer composites
* Multi-physics finite element analysis
* Time-dependent material behavior
* Smart materials and structures
* Nanocomposites
* Laminated composites
* Aerospace applications
